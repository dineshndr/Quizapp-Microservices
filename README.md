# Quiz Application Microservices

This project demonstrates a **Quiz Application Microservice** communicating with a **Question Application Microservice** using an **API Gateway**. The architecture leverages **Spring Boot**, **Spring Cloud**, **Eureka Server** for service discovery, and **OpenFeign** for inter-service communication.

## üß© Microservices Overview

### 1. **Quiz Application Microservice**

* Handles quizzes and interacts with the Question microservice to fetch questions.
* Uses OpenFeign to consume REST APIs exposed by the Question service.

### 2. **Question Application Microservice**

* Manages the questions and exposes REST APIs.

### 3. **API Gateway**

* Routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservice.
* Central point for routing, load balancing, and filtering.

### 4. **Eureka Discovery Server**

* Enables service registration and discovery among microservices.

## üîó Microservice Communication

* The **Quiz Microservice** communicates with the **Question Microservice** through REST APIs.
* **OpenFeign Client** is used for simplified and declarative HTTP communication.
* **Service discovery** is enabled using **Eureka Server** to register and locate services dynamically.

```java
@FeignClient("QUESTION-MICROSERVICE-APP")
public interface QuizInterface {
    @GetMapping("question/generate")
    public ResponseEntity<List<Integer>> getQuestionsForQuiz(@RequestParam String categoryName, @RequestParam Integer numOfQuestions);

    @PostMapping("question/getQuestions")
    public ResponseEntity<List<QuestionWrapper>> getQuestionsFromId(@RequestBody List<Integer> questionIds);

    @PostMapping("question/getScore")
    public ResponseEntity<Integer> getScore(@RequestBody List<Response> responses);
}
```
